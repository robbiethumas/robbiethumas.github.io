\f0\fs24 \cf0 The era of space travel and exploration is at an all time high. NASA, SpaceX, and many other companies are aimed towards learning what they can from our well-known universe. Being the one obsessed with space and fully enjoying it, I was happy to have a space theme stretch through this course and I am glad it played out to be a series of postcards, created in Adobe inDesign. The stamp and location at the bottom of the card is a little nod to the future of possible mail service between different planets. Once we become an interplanetary species, we will see a time when we put a stamp on a letter and send it miles and miles into space for another person to enjoy. Cheers to the future of space travel! }
