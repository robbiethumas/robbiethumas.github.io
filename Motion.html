<p>“Phil Arrives” is a short Time-Based Media piece of Phil’s constant journey to vacation at the most popular planet in the known-galaxy for the summer. Phil is trying so hard to find a nice place to visit, hence him landing on the planet known to house Max’s adventure? Is this a prequel to a possible friendship or is this just setting up Phil to become a possible meal for this Macaw? Who knows but Phil hopes to find some peace in this new place…for now. </p>
